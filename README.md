# portReporter

This script is built to scan a random IP address and will log the data about it. 

The scan will look for open, filtered, and closed ports if there is an open port it will pull the email from the IP.

All data will get stored in log files.

The __.log__ file contains the logs from the script, while __results.txt__ will contain the output of the script.

**Run pip install -r requirements.txt**
